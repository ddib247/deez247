        "Thanks for providing that example! This clarifies your FOML syntax a lot. It looks like a hierarchical, outline-style format where indentation defines structure, and `[]` and `()` denote different types of items.\n",

        "Based on this structure, a **tree diagram** or a **mind map** would be a very suitable way to visualize it. I propose we generate output in the **DOT language**, which can then be used with the [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) toolkit to create visual diagrams in formats like PNG, SVG, PDF, etc. Graphviz is a powerful open-source graph visualization software.\n",

        "2.  **Determine Hierarchy**: The indentation of each line will tell us its level in the hierarchy and its parent.\n",
        "3.  **Identify Node Types**: We'll distinguish between `[]` items (which we can consider primary topics/nodes) and `()` items (which seem like descriptions, sub-points, or notes).\n",
        "4.  **Construct Graph Data**: We'll build a list of nodes and the connections (edges) between them.\n",

        "### Explanation of the Code\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **`parse_foml_to_dot(foml_text)` function**:\n",
        "    * Initializes the DOT output with basic graph settings (`digraph FOMLDiagram { ... }`).\n",
        "        * `rankdir=LR;` sets the diagram layout from Left to Right. You can change this to `TB` for Top to Bottom.\n",
        "        * Default `node` and `edge` styles are set.\n",
        "    * `parent_stack`: A dictionary to keep track of the most recent node at each indentation level. This is crucial for connecting child nodes to their correct parents. `parent_stack[level] = node_id`.\n",
        "    * `node_counter`: Used to generate unique IDs for each node (e.g., `node0`, `node1`).\n",
        "    * **Indent Size Detection**: The code tries to automatically determine the number of spaces used for indentation based on the first indented line. This helps it adapt if your input uses, for example, 2 spaces instead of 4 for indentation.\n",
        "    * **Line Processing Loop**:\n",
        "        * It iterates through each non-empty line of the input.\n",
        "        * `leading_spaces`: Calculates the number of spaces at the beginning of the line.\n",
        "        * `current_level`: Divides `leading_spaces` by the `indent_size` (if determined) to find the hierarchy level.\n",
        "        * **Label and Type Extraction**:\n",
        "            * It checks if the line starts with `[` and ends with `]` or starts with `(` and ends with `)`.\n",
        "            * The content inside is extracted as `node_label`. Quotes `\"` within labels are escaped (`\\\\\"`) for valid DOT syntax.\n",
        "            * `node_shape` and `fillcolor` are set differently for `[]` items (styled as light blue boxes) and `()` items (styled as light yellow ellipses) for better visual distinction. Unrecognized lines are treated as `plaintext`.\n",
        "        * **Node Creation**: A unique `node_id` is generated. A DOT language string defining the node (with its ID, label, shape, and color) is added to the `nodes` list.\n",
        "        * **Edge Creation**:\n",
        "            * If `current_level > 0` (i.e., it's not a root node), it looks up the parent's ID from `parent_stack[current_level - 1]`.\n",
        "            * An edge `parent_id -> node_id;` is added to the `edges` list.\n",
        "        * **Updating `parent_stack`**: The current node `node_id` is stored in `parent_stack[current_level]`. Any entries in `parent_stack` for deeper levels (which are no longer direct ancestors) are removed to ensure correct parent assignment for subsequent lines.\n",
        "    * **Final DOT Output**: The collected `nodes` and `edges` are combined into the final DOT string.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Example Usage (`if __name__ == \"__main__\":`)**:\n",
        "    * The `foml_input` variable holds your example text.\n",
        "    * `parse_foml_to_dot()` is called with this input.\n",
        "    * The resulting DOT string is printed to the console.\n",
        "    * There's commented-out code showing how you can save this output directly to a `.dot` file (e.g., `foml_diagram.dot`).\n",
        "\n",
        "### How to Implement and Use\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Save the Code**: Copy the Python code above and save it as a Python file (e.g., `foml_parser.py`).\n",
        "2.  **Install Graphviz**: If you don't have it already, you need to install Graphviz.\n",
        "    * **Windows**: Download an installer from the [Graphviz download page](https://graphviz.org/download/). Make sure to add the Graphviz `bin` directory to your system's PATH environment variable.\n",
        "    * **macOS**: Using Homebrew: `brew install graphviz`\n",
        "    * **Linux**: Using apt (Debian/Ubuntu): `sudo apt-get install graphviz`\n",
        "        Using yum (Fedora/RHEL): `sudo yum install graphviz`\n",
        "3.  **Run the Python Script**:\n",
